<p class = "pmargin"><strong>Gratitude</strong> is a way of being aware and thankful for the positive things that happen. When life is hard, it can be easy to forget that many things are still going well.</p>

<p class = "pmargin">In psychology studies, practicing gratitude has been linked to people being happier. This is part of the field of Positive Psychology. [<a href="http://www.psykologtidsskriftet.no/pdf/2005/874-884.pdf">M Seligman 2005</a>, <a href ="http://www.stybelpeabody.com/newsite/pdf/gratitude.pdf">R Emmons 2003</a>] </p>

<p class = "pmargin">A <strong>gratitude journal</strong> is a tool for practicing gratitude. It involves writing down things for which one is thankful or appreciative.</p>

<h2 class ="hmargin">User's Manual</h2>
<ol>
<li class = "pmargin">Find a notebook that you want to write in. Keep it somewhere where you will use it each day like next to the bed.</li>
<li class = "pmargin">Pick a time to write each day: usually first thing in the morning or before going to sleep works best.</li>
<li class = "pmargin">When the time arrives, open up the journal and write about the things for which you are grateful.
<ul>
<li> Simple things like: A sunny day, A show you watched, A good meal </li>
<li> Big things like: Family, Love, Health, Adventure </li>
</ul>
<li class = "pmargin">Simply write 1-3 things down for which you are grateful. Of course you can write more if you like. </li>
<li class = "pmargin">Consider re-reading the journal each week.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p class = "pmargin largetop">Focusing and writing these things down can make a big difference. When we train ourselves in gratitude, we pay more attention to the positive parts of life.
