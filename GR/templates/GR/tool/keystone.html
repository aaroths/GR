<p class = "pmargin"><strong>Habits</strong> are behaviors that you perform on a regular basis. Often they are done as part of a routine or even done automatically as a result of lots of repetition and familiarity. They can be changed over time.</p>
<p class = "pmargin"><strong>Keystone habits</strong> are important habits which can change other habits in your life. They are the central pillars by which you can build happy and productive days.</p>
<p class = "pmargin">For example, picking a keystone habit like exercise may improve eating habits, sleep, and decrease anxiety-driven habits.</p>

 	<li class="pmargin">Is there a habit that when performed improves your wellness and productivity?</li>
 	<li class="pmargin">If so, try considering this a Keystone Habit. You can say "I am Keystoning" or "Time to Keystone!" to get you excited about it.</li>
 	<li class="pmargin">Do your Keystone Habit daily if possible. Consider using <a href="http://growingresilient.com/home/tools/dont-break-the-chain-2/">Don't Break the Chain</a> if you need motivation</li>
