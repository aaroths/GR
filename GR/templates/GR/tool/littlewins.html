<p class="pmargin" style="text-align: left;">Focusing on <strong>Small Victories</strong> each day can re-frame the world in a positive way. It is often tempting to focus on things that go wrong, but this can reinforce a negative state of mind. Small Victories can be a fun way to think about the positives.</p>
<p class="pmargin">A Small Victory could be :</p>

<ul>
 	<li class="pmargin">Making the bed in the morning</li>
 	<li class="pmargin">Cooking a healthy meal</li>
 	<li class="pmargin">Catching the bus</li>
 	<li class="pmargin">Having a good conversation</li>
</ul>
<h2 class = "hmargin">When to Use?</h2>
<p class="pmargin">Small Victories are a tool that can be helpful both in good times and hard times.</p>

<p class="pmargin">In hard times, they are one way of changing your attention to positive things. They can even be helpful after a very hard stress. Even if your energy is quite low, this can be a simple yet powerful tool.</p>

<p class="pmargin">When life is going well, Small Victories continue to show us things for which we can be grateful.</p>

<div class = "border">
<h2 class="hmargin">Try it:</h2>
<ol>
 	<li class="pmargin">Try to find at least one Small Victory each day - write it down.</li>
 	<li class="pmargin">At the end of the day, congratulate yourself on your Small Victory.</li>
 	<li class="pmargin">Try doing this for the whole week.</li>
        <li class = "pmargin">Consider sharing your victories with a friend.</li>
 	<li class="pmargin">At the end of the week, reflect on how it feels to consider Small Victories.</li>
</ol>
<p class = "pmargin">If it is helpful, make finding Small Victories a daily habit. </p>
