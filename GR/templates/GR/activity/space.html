<p class = "pmargin">A feeling of control is important for wellness. Given the uncertainty of the world and our surroundings, the easiest thing to control is ourselves and our reactions.</p>

<p class = "pmargin"><strong>A Space</strong> is a visualization exercise to control our reactions.</p>

<p class = "pmargin">We often have automatic responses and reactions to hard things that happen. These reactions are often directed by emotions and habits, and sometimes can cause harm to ourselves or others.</p>

<ul>
<li class ="pmargin">The first step toward changing negative responses is to notice them.</li>
<li class = "pmargin bigbottom">The second step is to take our time responding, and appreciate that we have the power to choose a different reaction.</li>
</ul>

<div class = "border">
<h2 class="hmargin">Exercise</h2>
<p class="pmargin">1. Take a moment to consider the quotation below:</p>
<p class="bigtab" style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>“Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”</strong>   <br></em>-Victor Frankl, Austrian Psychiatrist</p>
<p class="pmargin">2. Visualize this Space around or inside yourself. Let the Space take whatever form makes sense to you.</p>
<p class="pmargin">3. Take 5 Minutes to think about and appreciate this Space.</p>
</div>

<p class = "pmargin largetop">This space can become a useful tool. Next time feel attacked by events from the outside, try to visualize that space before finding your response. </p>
