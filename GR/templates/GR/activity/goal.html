<p class="pmargin">Considering big-picture goals can keep us oriented and directed toward what really matters to us. Building discrete goals can be the best way to ground ourselves. In this activity, there are 3 types of goals.</p>

<div class = "border">
<p class = "pmargin smallbottom"><strong>Top-level goals</strong> are like a compass setting or a general direction to take. These are major life-long goals that you feel will be important for your satisfaction with life. There will be many different ways to get there. </p>
<ul>
 	<li class = "pmargin"><em>Examples</em>: Succeeding at work;  Contributing to society; Building a positive legacy; Having a happy family</li>
</ul>
<p class = "pmargin smallbottom"><strong>Mid-level goals </strong>are more discrete yet still large goals which can allow you to achieve top-level goals.</p>
<ul>
 	<li class = "pmargin"><em>Examples</em>: Complete more training at work; Help with a community project; Take a family vacation </li>
</ul>
<p class = "pmargin smallbottom"><strong>Low-level goals</strong> are specific tasks or things we can actually do in the short-term. A good goal is: </p>
<ul>
 	<li class = "pmargin">Specific</li>
 	<li class = "pmargin">Measurable</li>
 	<li class = "pmargin">Actionable (Something that can be done)</li>
 	<li class = "pmargin">Timely</li>
 	<li class = "pmargin"><em>Examples</em>: Do 3 hours of learning around a new topic; Get the things on the shopping list; Help your children with their math homework today</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class = "pmargin"> Goals reinforce our core values and remind us what is most important to us. When we understand our goals, we also get a strong sense of purpose and identity. The Philosopher Nietzsche said : <i>“He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” </i></p>

<ol>
 	<li class="pmargin">Begin by writing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> your </span>top-level goals right at the top. Most people have 1-3 of these.</li>
 	<li class="pmargin">Under each top-level goal, draw mid-level goals that will help you get you there.</li>
