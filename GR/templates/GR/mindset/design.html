<p class = "pmargin"><strong>Design Thinking</strong> is a fantastic way to get unstuck. If it's hard to figure out exactly what you want to do with the rest of your life, you are not alone.

<p class = "pmargin">For years, entrepreneurs and designers everywhere have been optimizing the process of design to make things better. These same concepts can be applied to your life.

<p class = "pmargin"><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"><em><strong>Design Thinking </strong>is a mindset that helps one find and maintain a healthy and satisfying path in life</em>. This is done by asking the right questions, considering solutions, and then trying things and adapting with feedback.</span>

<p class = "pmargin">A key part of Design Thinking is to graciously take <strong>feedback</strong> from yourself and others - this can be hard. Remember, no one is perfect and <em>feedback is a gift</em> that allows us to improve.
