<p class ="pmargin"><strong>Vulnerability</strong> is a mindset described by social researcher Brené Brown involving accepting emotional exposure and uncertainty. This leads to increasing connection with others.</p>

<p class = "pmargin">It requires acceptance of our imperfections - <strong>perfectionism</strong> itself is an unrealistic and impossible goal.  Since vulnerability accepts ourselves as imperfect, it acts to reduce the shame we feel for who we are.</p>

<p class = "pmargin"><strong>Shame</strong> involves telling ourselves that we are not worthy of positive connection with the world. It can also be looked at as a comparison between who we are and who we think we should be. The first step to reducing shame is to embrace our imperfections and feel that we are enough just as we are today.</p>

<p class = "pmargin">Initially, being Vulnerable with others can feel exposing and risky. However, those who get practice being vulnerable and open can find huge pay-offs such as satisfaction, reduced stress, and deep connections with others. </p>
