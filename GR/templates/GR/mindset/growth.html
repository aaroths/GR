<p class = "pmargin">A mindset popularized by Carol Dweck, a psychologist at Stanford. There are two mindsets she described:
<ul>
 	<li class = "pmargin"><strong>Growth Mindset</strong> - You believe that you can learn new skills and grow with effort.</li>
 	<li class = "pmargin"><strong>Fixed Mindset</strong> - You believe you don't and can't change much. Either you are good at something, or you aren't. Period.</li>
</ul>

<p class = "pmargin smallbottom">In Parenting, Organizations, and in Life, there are many benefits to the Growth Mindset.
<ul>
 	<li class ="pmargin">More Resilience</li>
 	<li class = "pmargin">Higher self-confidence</li>
 	<li class = "pmargin">Increase in satisfaction and wellness</li>
 	<li class = "pmargin">Avoids blame and victimization</li>
</ul>
<p class = "pmargin smallbottom">To encourage this in yourself and others:
<ul class = "largebottom">
 	<li class = "pmargin">Understand that skill is a result of effort</li>
 	<li class = "pmargin">Accept that failure is a part of progress</li>
 	<li class = "pmargin bigbottom">Do not reward accomplishments alone, rather reward the effort and growth involved in the process</li>
</ul>

<div class = "border">
<h2 class = "hmargin">Activity:</h2>
<ol>
 	<li class = "pmargin">Pick a hobby you have always wanted to learn, but were "bad at." (eg: art, language, writing, cooking, etc)</li>
 	<li class = "pmargin">Adopt a Growth Mindset and tell yourself you can learn.</li>
 	<li class = "pmargin">Pick a duration of time you will try out the hobby. Eg: 1 month</li>
 	<li class = "pmargin">Try the hobby and try working at it, even if you feel "bad" at it.</li>
 	<li class = "pmargin">Reflect at the end of your time interval. <i>How do you feel about the hobby? How do you feel about yourself? </i></li>
</ol>
